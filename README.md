#### Budgeting app that allows users to track income and expenses in a given month while monitoring the percentage breakdown of each.

### Functionality
This app was built using Vanilla **JavaScript**. A user can choose whether they are submitting an income or an expense and the data is added to its respective array. This array is mapped over and a new div is created and populated with the data for each income or expense. A percentage is displayed next to each entry based on the income or expense compared to the total amount of money exchanged in the month. An income or expense can be deleted and the running totals will updated automatically.

### Design
This application uses two separate colors carried throughout the design to distinguish between an income and an expense which allows the user to easily navigate the page.
